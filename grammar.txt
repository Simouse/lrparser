! This is a comment
! You can use '!' just like "//" in C99 and C++.

# '#' style comment is also supported. (Doing so will allow
# you to use the comment function provided by your editor when
# you associate this text file with bash mode. You can temporarily
# comment some grammar rules and later uncomment them easily
# in this way.)

# But "//" and "/**/" are not supported

! Escape sequences are not supported, which means you
! cannot use "'" and '"' together. To use one of them,
! you need to use the other as the quote sign.

# TERM :{ID, PLUS, TIMES, "(", ')', '+', '*'}
