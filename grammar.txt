# This is a comment
# You can use '!' just like "//" in C99 and C++.

# '#' style comment is also supported. (Doing so will allow
# you to use the comment function provided by your editor when
# you associate this text file with bash mode. You can temporarily
# comment some grammar rules and later uncomment them easily
# in this way.)

# But "//" and "/**/" are not supported

# Escape sequences are not supported, which means you
# cannot use "'" and '"' together. To use one of them,
# you need to use the other as the quote sign.

# \epsilon \e _e are reserved as aliases for epsilon. You may need to use
# it in your productions.

# "$" is reserved for end-of-input, so do not use it in your productions.
